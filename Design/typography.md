# Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters. The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.

A good designer should do good mobile typography design to ease user’s eye and make the interaction more productive.

### Font
- Different type of content requires different font, because font can express feelings.

### Font Size
- Smaller text may hurt user’s eye and takes more time to read, while bigger text may use up the screen quickly and break in the reading coherence.
- Small fonts on a bright mobile screen can make user’s eyes hurt from tension and bring a headache.
-  For iOS, use text size that’s at least 11 points, while for Android, choose 14 sp for main text.

### Typeface and brand
- use a single typeface and few font variants and sizes.
- it is recommended to keep a number of fonts within two or three to make text look solid.

### Text styles
- use built-in text styles whenever possible.

### Leading
- Leading is the space between lines. Mobile screen is smaller, so leading is usually smaller than a desktop version.
- Many believe 1.4em is the standard leading, but still, it’s a little bit shorter, users may have a feeling that the text is tighten up.

### Line lengths
- The length of a text line can impact the whole typography.
- Keep the number of character per line within 30–40 is a good choice.

### Space
- pace can bring the feeling of freedom and relaxing. Space in mobile typography mainly contains: space between lines, space in the margins, paragraph space.

### Hierarchy
- Mobile screens have a more limited space, so many designers apply only 2 levels. A headline and a body is enough, headlines is to grab the reader instantly and the body toward readability.

### Contrast
- The biggest rule is to weaken the contrast.
- using right color can make your UI interface looks perfect. Moreover, font size is another big consideration of contrast.

### Kerning
- Kerning is the spacing of two letter. It is a quite tiny factor in mobile typography but worth attention.

### Tracking
- Tracking is the letter spacing of all characters.
- Effective tracking makes text more readable. Usually, font usage can adjust tracking appropriately, so you don’t need to adjust tracking often.

### Alignment
- Left side alignment is the best choice.
- allows user’s eyes jump from one end of a line to the next consistently.
